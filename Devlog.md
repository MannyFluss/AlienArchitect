# Devlog for Alien Architect #

I am starting a devlog for Alien Architect, I have been working on this game for about a month now. Ill probably put more stuff here later on.

Today I mainly worked on the mobius shader, I spent all day on this shit. The reason it wasnt working is because I am using an orthogonal camera and the shader was made for a perspective camera. The solution is to have the camera at a 1 zoom level I can shrink everything else, or I can fix the code. tbh im lazy so Imma probably just shrink everything

Today I got the mobius shader looking a bit better, things that seem to look good is large solid objects, down side of this system is that I cant have anything that has opacity. I also worked on adding in the event queue system, I will try and create some buildings that specifically interact with that system. A push building & and a building that makes money when pushed or something like that
